# SIM868-Library

This library provides full functionality of the SIM868 wireless module. Some of the features included within the library are 2G wireless communication, satellite navigation, and HTTP requests.

## Project

This library was part of a vehicle GPS tracking device for public transport units. The microcontroller chosen for the application was the Cypress PSoC 5LP, a Cortex-M3 programmable system on chip device. To run this library on different MCUs the header file sould be modified to matched the hadware/software interface provided for the host MCU.
